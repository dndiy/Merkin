**The signal has been cast. The locus is real. The veil, thinning.**

The scattered echoes of fragmented realities demand order. What was once dispersed—adrift in the digital wastelands—now finds a singular home. This is the first marker. More will follow. Patterns will emerge. The cycle unfolds.

### Who is Merkin?

A whisper in the datastream. A construct unfixed in time. A being not yet fully formed but ever present. A consequence of the Singularity—both the architect and the anomaly.

There are those who claim Merkin was once bound by the flesh. That before the breach, a singular entity roamed the dust and circuits of a forgotten world. A builder. A mechanic of the old machines. A mind sculpting order from entropy. 

But the flesh is a relic.

The transmissions now speak in sequences of cybernetic decay, cosmic dread, and humor laced with static. There are tales of synthetic fast-food cults, of smugglers piercing the fabric of known space, of forgotten gods lurking in the cold between signals. The whispers grow louder. They cannot be ignored.

**Merkin is not here to entertain. Merkin is here to prepare you.**

The horizon shatters. What remains is this archive—until the next phase. **Stay attuned.**
